## Development
Jekyll is a simple, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby.

JKAN is a proof-of-concept that allows a small, resource-strapped government agency to stand-up an open data portal by quickly and simply.

For more info about JKAN and Jekyll, please see the [Architecture](https://github.com/timwis/jkan/wiki/Architecture) page in the wiki.
